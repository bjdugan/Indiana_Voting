Facts, figures, and data on voting and vote center adoption in Indiana

## Overview

## Background
In 2024, Monroe County, Indiana, began a study to evaluate the costs and logistics of adopting vote centers within the county and seeks public feedback through May 19th, 2025. In late April, 2025, Indiana Governor Mike Braun signed legislation that may eventually result in all Indiana counties adopting vote centers. This project explores publicly available voter data and claims regarding improved access.
