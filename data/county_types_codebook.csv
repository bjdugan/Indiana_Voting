"Metro2023","Classifications of counties are based on the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) definition of Metropolitan Statistical Areas as defined in the July 2023 Bulletin Number 23-01. Metropolitan statistical areas have at least one urban area of 50,000 or more population, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured by commuting ties. 0 = counties that do not belong to metropolitan statistical areas 1 = counties that belong to metropolitan statistical areas. The OMB produced 2023 Core Based Statistical Area designations for Connecticut's Planning Region geographies (FIPS codes 09110 to 09190) but not for Connecticut's county geographies (FIPS codes 09001 to 09015). USDA, Economic Research Service (ERS) treated Litchfield County, CT and Windham County, CT as nonmetropolitan and all other Connecticut counties as metropolitan for the purposes of this data product. This treatment is reflected in the Metro2023 variable in this data product."

"Economic Typology Codes","The economic typology codes include the set of six high industry concentration codes and the industry dependence code. These codes are based primarily on labor and proprietors' earnings and jobs data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis' (BEA) Regional Economic Accounts, released in November 2023. Non-publicly available, unsuppressed earnings and jobs estimates are used for counties in 40 States and Washington, D.C. Estimates for counties in Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Vermont come from the publicly available BEA files where possible, and are supplemented with alternative data if values for 2019, 2021, and 2022 are suppressed. If complete data for 2019, 2021, and 2022 are not available, the following alternatives are used: 1) If one or two of the three years (2019, 2021, or 2022) used to calculate the 3-year average are suppressed, then a single year or a two-year average of the available years of data is used. 2) If data for 2019, 2021, and 2022 are suppressed, the most recent single year of BEA data going back to and including 2013 is used. 3) If no BEA data are available from 2013 onward, the following alternatives are used. a) Available subindustry BEA earnings data from 2019, 2021, and 2022 are summed and the shares are averaged to create an underestimate of earnings for the high mining, manufacturing, and recreation concentration codes and industry dependence code. b) Employment data from the S2403 table of the 2018–22 ACS are used for the high mining, manufacturing, and recreation concentration codes and industry dependence code. c) For the High Government Concentration code, BEA Federal, State, and local government earnings and jobs from 2019, 2021, and 2022 are used. d) Separate thresholds are calculated for counties that use ACS employment data and for counties that use Federal, State, and local government data for the High Government Concentration code. e) For the Industry Dependence code, an alternative method is used to determine if a county is government dependent. In cases where the State government (alone) earnings and jobs are not available in the BEA data, counties’ Federal and State government earnings and jobs shares are estimated by subtracting the nonmetro mean share of earnings and jobs in local government from the county’s share of earnings and jobs in Federal, State, and local government. State and local government earnings and employment are available as a combined industry in the BEA data and neither Federal government nor the combined State and local industry are suppressed for any counties."
NA,"Farm earnings and employment refers to the earnings and jobs of sole proprietors, partners, and hired laborers engaged in the direct production of agricultural commodities, either livestock or crops."
NA,"Mining earnings and employment refers to the earnings and jobs from mining, quarrying, oil and gas extraction, and support activities for mining."

"County coverage",NA
"County typology codes are assigned to all counties for which data are enumerated in the data source files. The number of counties with available data varies by data source (Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) vs. Census Bureau) and by year. The BEA combines Virginia's independent cities with nearby counties and reports data for the combined area only. The BEA also combines Maui, HI and Kalawao, HI into a single geographic area. The Economic Typology Codes are based on the earnings and jobs shares of these county/city combinations, but codes for the combined counties and cities are reported separately in the data file. The county/city combinations used by the BEA are listed below as are the Census county names and FIPS codes that are used to report the Economic Typology Codes. BEA data and Census data prior to the 2018–22 ACS report data for Connecticut's eight counties, while Census data from 2022 onward report data for Connecticut's nine planning regions. For the purposes of this data product, Litchfield County, CT and Windham County, CT were designated by ERS as nonmetropolitan and all other counties in Connecticut were designated as metropolitan.

The population loss code relies on Decennial Census data from 2000, 2010, and 2020. Counties that did not exist in 2000 or 2010 are not assigned population loss codes. Bedford city, VA was added to Bedford County, VA in 2013 and Clifton Forge city, VA was added to Alleghany County, VA in 2001. The population data for these county/city combinations were summed in the Decennial Census years prior to their mergers to create a consistent geography for the population loss county code. See the Census Bureau's website for more information on changes to county geographies (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/county-changes.2020.html). The persistent poverty code follows the methodology outlined in ERS' Poverty Area Measures data product (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/poverty-area-measures).",NA
